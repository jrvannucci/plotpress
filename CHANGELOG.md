# Changelog

All notable changes to simpleplot are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Versions come from git tags: a release *is* a `v*` tag, and the package version
is derived from it at build time rather than written down anywhere in the source.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-26

First public release.

simpleplot renders SVG and self-contained interactive HTML through a
matplotlib-shaped API, with no global state and no compiled extension.

### Added

- **Figure/Axes core** with no `pyplot` and no global `rcParams`. A `Figure`
  owns its axes and its own `Style`; two figures never share mutable state.
  `simpleplot.subplots()` mirrors `plt.subplots()` without touching globals.
- **Output surfaces**: static vector SVG, raster PNG (Pillow), vector PDF
  (svglib + reportlab), self-contained interactive HTML, inline SVG for
  Jupyter, a native pop-up window (`[gui]` extra), and a PyQt/PySide widget
  (`[qt]` extra).
- **Plot types** covering the core of matplotlib's reference grid: `plot`,
  `scatter`, `bar`/`barh`, `hist`, `step`, `fill_between`, `stem`, `errorbar`,
  `imshow`, `pcolormesh`, `pie`, `boxplot`, `violinplot`, `eventplot`,
  `quiver`, `contour`/`contourf`, `hist2d`, `stackplot`, `hexbin`, `matshow`,
  `spy`, `broken_barh`, `stairs`, `axline`, and `plot_frames`.
- **Signal processing** in pure NumPy: `psd`, `csd`, `cohere`,
  `magnitude_spectrum`, `angle_spectrum`, `phase_spectrum`, `specgram`,
  `xcorr`, `acorr`.
- **Polar and 3-D projections**, projected onto the 2-D core.
- **Axis control**: log scales, equal aspect, shared axes, `twinx`/`twiny`,
  `tight_layout`, colorbars (single or shared across axes), legends, text and
  annotations, and figure-level titles.
- **Colormaps** — viridis, plasma, inferno, magma, cividis, coolwarm, RdBu,
  gray and `_r` variants — with `Normalize`, `LogNorm`, `PowerNorm` and
  `SymLogNorm`.
- **Interactive toolbar** in HTML and pop-up output: per-axes data-space zoom
  and pan with live ticks, point picking with keyboard traversal, in-browser
  annotation, sliders over extra dimensions, and CSV/JSON extraction. The
  JavaScript is inlined and makes no external requests, so it works under
  strict CSPs.
- **Font metrics** for the base-14 metric families — Helvetica, Times and
  Courier, each in regular, bold, italic and bold-italic — plus DejaVu Sans,
  covering their metric-compatible clones (Arial, Liberation Sans/Serif/Mono,
  Arimo, Tinos, Cousine). Families outside those groups are measured as
  Helvetica; `Style(measure_installed_fonts=True)` opts into measuring the font
  files actually installed, trading cross-machine reproducibility for fidelity.
- **Performance** from NumPy rather than native code: vectorized coordinate
  formatting and min/max decimation of huge lines. Against matplotlib on one
  machine, roughly 700x on a 300x300 `pcolormesh`, 40x on an 8x8 axes grid, 8x
  on a 5k-point scatter and 5.5x on a 100k-point line, measured over build plus
  SVG serialization.

### Known limitations

Documented in full at
<https://jrvannucci.github.io/simpleplot/user_guide/limitations.html>: font
families outside the bundled metric groups, PNG as a second renderer rather
than a rasterized SVG, approximate density estimates for large samples, 3-D and
polar as projections onto the 2-D core, and no `streamplot`/`barbs`,
triangulation, geographic projections, animation API, rich text or math
rendering.
